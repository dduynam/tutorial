Usage of its
    - Bubble sort: use in case the number of array is significant.
    
    - Quick sort: Divide and conquer algorithm.
    
    - Insertion sort: works similar to the way we sort playing cards in our hands. 
        --> Description:    The array is split into a sorted (left) and an unsorted (right) part. Values from unsorted part is picked
                            and placed at the correct position in the sorted part. 
                            Time complexity: O(n^2)
        --> Boundary Case: when the elements in the array are sorted in reverse order of the sequence after sorting. 
        --> Algorithm Paradigm: Incremental Approach
        --> Usage: sort playing card, while the left array is already sorted and just add a new element.

    - Merge sort: Divde and conquer algorithm
