Docker Concept
    Offer deploy or development for application (container) to developer and system admin 

    The difference between docker and virtual machine
    * Virtual Machine:
        + Hypervisor: help to connect the underlying layer (Infrastructure,...), run on individual Kernel (Guest OS)
        + 
    * Docker: 
        + Use common OS (Host OS) --> decrease the size of container greatly
        + Share kernel, Unix file
        + Light weight platform

    When run the apps on the VM, it will take a long time to open it. While docker can help to open fast significantly

    Keyword: 
        - image: executable package (library, code, config, variable enviroment,...)
        - container: runtime instance of image (execute the image)
        - Dockerfile: environment information contained on text file. (environment, path,...)

    Usage of docker
        - Ensure the consistency of environment on all utilized machines. 
        - There is existing image --> easy for newcomers to set up system with installing any dependency additionally.
        - Faster then VM.

    Basis of use: 
        1. Create Dockerfile
        2. Build image from dockerfile
        3. Execute image to create container.

    Common Commands:
        docker build -t 'image-tag' 'address of build context containing dockerfile'
        docker run -p 'host port':'docker port' 'image-tag'
        docker ps (check the current container list)
        docker images (check the current image list)

    Note: 
    -t /tag/
    docker build -t my-node-app:v0.0.1 .
    docker run -p 5001:8080 my-node-app:v0.0.1 /bind port 5001 on your PC to 8080 port of Docker/
    docker ps /show current/
    docker container stop <container-name> /turn off the container/

Docker Compose (huge system - using micro service)
Summary:
    - Docker compose: a tool to define and run multi-container in Docker application
    - Config server and app in docker-compose.yml file
    - Run by command line

Example: 
    1. Course Service run-based nodejs plays as API
    2. There is a html file to get data from API and display data

Pros: 
    - Migrate a entire system to another PC easily by calling docker compose up (just need to modify config)
    - Containers working on the docker compose can connect to each other.
